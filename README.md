# Koori Culture Website designed by Billy and Changken with HTML and CSS
This website is part of our Year 10 Digital Technology project at school, created by Year 10 students Changken Chan and Billy Wu.
If you copy or plagarise our website than that is not poggers and we will be very angry. Ain't a good idea to make us angry y'all.
Please enjoy our website and our enriching information in support of Indigenous Koori Culture.

This website contains the following pages for the public to view and to expand their knowledge on Indigenous culture:

Health and Wellbeing - Information regarding the health, wellbeing and education about Koori people, along with a basic introduction of their culture

Food - Showcasing an example of a traditional Indigenous food created by Billy

Dance - A video of a traditional dance performed by Changken

Art - Contains a digital Indigenous-inspired artwork created by Changken using SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) which will never lose clarity

We hope that you learnt something new after looking through our website. Now sit back and enjoy the enriching content! - Billy and Changken

Due to Changken forgetting where he saved his SVG I had to make an entirely new SVG in a very short amount of time using a file instead of inline code.

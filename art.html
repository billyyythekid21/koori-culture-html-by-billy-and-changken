<h3>Introduction to the Koori Artwork</h3>
<div class="Intro">
  <p11>Today Changken Chan presents us with his own artwork, mostly in the style of Indigenous Australian art and culture. Using the power of SVG,
  this ensures that his artwork is able to be seen online without any loss of clarity or quality.</p11>

<h3>Description of Artwork</h3>
<div class="Desc">
  <p12>Dear Liberals and Communists, why do we need a description if the art doesn't exist yet? Curious.</p12>

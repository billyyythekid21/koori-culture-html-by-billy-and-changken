  <h3>Introduction to Indigenous Koori culture</h3>
  <p3>The Koori Culture is Australia's Indigenous culture that originates from parts of nowadays-New South Wales and Victoria. They have a belief
that they are part of the land and have a duty to take care of it, unlike the European way of owning land and property.
They have been in Australia for at leat 65000 years, and their culture have flourished for many years until the British came in 1788 and their population
was reduced from 250000 people in 1788 to only 60000 in the year 1920. They were considered <i>flora and fauna</i> by the government, and this meant that
killing Indigenous people was basically unregulated. Also, they did not even 'own' their land under colonial and Australian law, as Australia was considered
<i>terra nullis</i> (land owned by no one). This all changed in the 1960's, when the Australian Government made a decision to grant all Indigenous people
legal rights and protections, and to reconcile for the past, as Indigenous children were forcibly taken by the government in the early to mid 1900's to 'integrate
them with white Australia' in missionaries, and Indigenous land was taken away by the colonialists and many of the people were massacred.
Even though Indigenous people have special protections and benefits under state and Commonwealth law, unfortunately the Indigenous Koori people
suffer from historical institutional racism, neglect by the government welfare systems and the reluctancy of politicians
to pass laws to improve their health and wellbeing, and live harsher and less economically able lives than the rest of Australia's population.
Today on this website, we will look at various facts and data comparing the Koori people to the non-Indigenous people of Australia.
For more information, a table of comparison statistics is provided below if dot points are hard to read.

<h3>Health</h3>
  <p4>
    <ul>
      <li>Koori individuals will live 8-10 years shorter lives than non-Kooris between 2015 and 2017 in NSW and Victoria. </li>
      <li>Median age of NSW Kooris were 22, which is vastly different to the average age of 38 for the non-Koori community, which is also reflected in their lower life expectancies.</li>
      <li>7.6% of NSW Kooris are found to be disabled, compared to only 5.6% of NSW non-Kooris, and the gap between those two groups is currently widening. Also, 36% of the disabled Koori NSW population are under 25, in contrast to 12.7% of NSW non-Kooris, which is a very concerning statistic that needs to be solved.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Wellbeing</h3>
  <p5>
    <ul>
      <li>In NSW, Koori children are only half as likely to complete secondary school compared with NSW non-Kooris.</li>
      <li>Only 56.5% of Victorian Kooris aged 25-34 have some form of tertiary education, compared to 74.9% of Victorian non-Kooris.</li>
      <li>Less than half of all NSW Kooris own their own properties, compared to 70% of non-Kooris.</li>
      <li>32.4% of NSW Koori households earn below $500/week, compared to 22.3% of NSW non-Indigenous households.</li>
      <li>An underemployment (not unemployment) rate of 43% is true for NSW Koori individuals, compared to only 35.9% of non-Koori individuals in New South Wales. </li>
      <li>Kooris are three times less likely to work in professional services than non-Kooris.</li>
      <li>In Victoria, Kooris are 14.5 times more likely to be locked up, and NSW Kooris are 9.5 times more likely than their non-Koori counterparts.</li>
      <li>Victorian Koori children are 10 times more likely to be locked up in youth detention centres, and NSW Koori children are 16 times more likely.</li>
      <li>Koori communities experience higher rates of suicide than non-Indigenous communities. Causes of mental health issues in Indigenous Australians include loss of their culture and identity, trauma and grief from the Stolen Generation days, racism and prejudice, substance abuse, domestic violence and prison incarceration.
      <li>Indigenous prisoners represented just over a quarter of the total full-time adult prisoner population whilst accounting for around 2% of the total Australian population aged 18 years and over</li>
      <li>Median weekly income for Indigenous Australians was $542 in 2014-15 compared with $852 for non-Indigenous Australians.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Education</h3>
  <p6>
    <ul>
      <li>About 62% of Indigenous students finished year 12 or equivalent in 2014-15, compared to 86% of non-Indigenous Australians.</li>
      <li>The employment to population rate was around 75% for non-Indigenous Australians, compared to 48% for indigenous 15-64 year olds.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Possible methods of improvement</h3>
  <p6>
    <ul>
      <li>Increase funding for social and welfare services for Indigenous Australians.</li>
      <li>A focus on rehabilitaion and education in prisons, rather than punishment. Make prisons actually improve prisoners' post-prison lives.</li>
      <li>Treat drug and alcohol offences as a health issue, not a criminal matter. It worked for Portugal when they saw a significant decrease in drug use.</li>
      <li>Bring more funding into educating Indigenous Australian children, especially in remote and regional schools.</li>
      <li>Encourage more Indigenous people to work in higher-skilled professions.</li>
      <li>Regional and remote medical facilities require more money from the federal and state governments.</li>
      <li>Edit legislation to close any remaining loopholes that allow the discrimination of Indigenous Australians.</li>
    </ul>

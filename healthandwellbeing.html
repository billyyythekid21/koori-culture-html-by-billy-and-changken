    <p2>The Koori Culture is Australia's Indigenous culture that originates from parts of nowadays-New South Wales and Victoria.
  Unfortunately, the Indigenous Koori people suffer from historical institutional racism and the reluctantness of politicians
  to pass laws to improve their health and wellbeing, and live harsher and less economically able lives than the rest of Australia's population.
  Today on this website, we will look at various facts and data comparing the Koori people to the non-Indigenous people of Australia.

<h3>Health</h3>
  <p3>
    <ul>
      <li>Koori individuals are more likely to live 8-10 years shorter lives than non-Kooris between 2015 and 2017 in NSW and Victoria. </li>
      <li>Median age of NSW Kooris were 22, which is vastly different to the average age of 38 for the non-Koori community, which is also reflected in their lower life expectancies.</li>
      <li>7.6% of NSW Kooris are found to be disabled, compared to only 5.6% of NSW non-Kooris, and the gap between those two groups is currently widening. Also, 36% of the disabled Koori NSW population are under 25, in contrast to 12.7% of NSW non-Kooris, which is a very concerning statistic that needs to be solved.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Wellbeing</h3>
  <p4>
    <ul>
      <li>In NSW, Koori children are only half as likely to complete secondary school compared with NSW non-Kooris.</li>
      <li>Only 56.5% of Victorian Kooris aged 25-34 have some form of tertiary education, compared to 74.9% of Victorian non-Kooris.</li>
      <li>Less than half of all NSW Kooris own their own properties, compared to 70% of non-Kooris.</li>
      <li>32.4% of NSW Koori households earn below $500/week, compared to 22.3% of NSW non-Indigenous households.</li>
      <li>An underemployment (not unemployment) rate of 43% is true for NSW Koori individuals, compared to only 35.9% of non-Koori individuals in New South Wales. </li>
      <li>Kooris are three times less likely to work in professional services than non-Kooris.</li>
      <li>In Victoria, Kooris are 14.5 times more likely to be locked up, and NSW Kooris are 9.5 times more likely than their non-Koori counterparts.</li>
      <li>Victorian Koori children are 10 times more likely to be locked up in youth detention centres, and NSW Koori children are 16 times more likely.</li>
      <li>Koori communities experience higher rates of suicide than non-Indigenous communities. Causes of mental health issues in Indigenous Australians include loss of their culture and identity, trauma and grief from the Stolen Generation days, racism and prejudice, substance abuse, domestic violence and prison incarceration.
      <li>Indigenous prisoners represented just over a quarter of the total full-time adult prisoner population whilst accounting for around 2% of the total Australian population aged 18 years and over</li>
      <li>Median weekly income for Indigenous Australians was $542 in 2014-15 compared with $852 for non-Indigenous Australians.</li>
</li>
    </ul>
  </p4>
<h3>Education</h3>
 <p5>
   <ul>

     <li>The employment to population rate was around 75% for non-Indigenous Australians, compared to 48% for indigenous 15-64 year olds.</li>
   </ul>

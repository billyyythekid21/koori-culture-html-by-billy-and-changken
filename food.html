<h3>Introduction to Damper</h3>
<div class="Intro">
  <p8>Today, Billy Wu has decided to cook damper, which is a traditional Indigenous soda bread made by the Indigenous population and white settlers
      in Australia for many years. Unfortunately a photograph is unavailable yet, but he will make some shortly, so for now please enjoy some KFC chaps.</p8>

<h3>Recipe</h3>
<div class="Recipe">
  <p9>
    <b>Ingredients</b>
    <ul>
      <li>450g (3 cups) of self-raising flour</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>80g chilled and cubed butter</li>
      <li>185mL(3/4 cup) of water</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Steps</b>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees Celsius and line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper.</li>
      <li>Mix flour and salt in a large bowl. Use your fingertips to rub the butter into the flour until the mixture looks like breadcrumbs.</li>
      <li>Add water into the flour mixture and use a round-bladed knife to mix until the mixture comes together. If needed, add 1-2 tablespoons of water if the mixture is dry. Use hands to bring mixture together.</li>
      <li>Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and then knead it gently until smooth (should take 1-2 minutes).</li>
      <li>Shape into an 18 centimetre disc and place on baking tray.</li>
      <li>Use sharp knife that has been dipped lightly into flour to mark 8 wedges on the top. Dust damper with a little bit of flour.</li>
      <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, at least until it's cooked through and makes a hollow noise when tapped on base.</li>
      <li>Transfer to a wire rack for cooling. 5 minutes should do.</li>
      <li>Serve at room temperature or warm.</li>
    </ol>

<p2>Welcome to our website, created by Billy Wu and Changken Chan as our Year 10 Digital Technology project. The purpose of this website is to showcase Australia's
Indigenous Koori Culture, a locally well-known but disadvantaged and underrepresented population. What is the word 'Koori'?
It is from the Awabakal language, native to Australia. This word is used instead of European terms in order to promote traditional Indigenous
language. 40% of Indigenous people reside in either the states of New South Wales or Victoria, and unfortunately 75% of Australians hold negative
views towards Indigenous people due to various issues plaguing the Indigenous population which have placed them at a disadvantage compared to the
non-Indigenous Australian population.</p2>

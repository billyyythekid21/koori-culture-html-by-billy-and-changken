 <p2>Welcome to our website, created by Billy Wu and Changken Chan for our Year 10 Digital Technology project. The purpose of this website is to showcase Australia's
 Indigenous Koori Culture, a locally well-known but disadvantaged and underrepresented population. What is the word 'Koori'?
 It is from the Indigenous Awabakal language, one of the hundreds of indigenous languages native to Australia. This word is used instead of English terms in order to promote traditional Indigenous
 language. 40% of Indigenous people reside in either the states of New South Wales or Victoria, and unfortunately 75% of Australians hold negative
 views towards Indigenous people due to various issues plaguing the Indigenous population which have placed them at a disadvantage compared to the
 non-Indigenous Australian population. The federal government's aim is to eliminate those gaps, differences and negative opinions about the Koori population
 and to eliminate class inequality between the Indigenous people and the rest of the Australian population. But with many obstacles and funding cuts for
 vital social services and the reluctance for many politicians to get on board with supporting an expensive assistance legislation, it may very well take many years
 for any significant support legislation to pass through Parliament. We hope that you learnt something new after looking through our website. Now sit back and enjoy the enriching content! - Billy and Changken</p2>
